This is simple website that can check images for similiarity using OpenCV.js

You can save images in db. I used MySQL and PHP PDO for this in project.

And you can select image to compare it with images in db.

You can see result how images are similiar for each other.

I used Histogram Compare for this.

For more information on this, please have a look on https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d5/d10/tutorial_js_root.html
